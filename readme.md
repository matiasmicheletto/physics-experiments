# Javascript 3D Mechanics Experiments

This is a small compendium of javascript 3D animations that allows the user to perform mechanics experiments with simple bodies and systems. In the [/doc](/doc) folder you can find the mathematical modeling of each system.

This is a small part of a bigger project that was developed in the context of an internship carried out in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computers, at National University of the South.
